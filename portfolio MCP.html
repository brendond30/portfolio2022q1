            <p1 class="font-offwhite font-light margin-top">For this assignment, everybody was tasked with creating their own logo, letterhead, and business card.</p1>
            <p2 class="font-offwhite font-light margin-top">I wanted to keep my logo minimal and clean. It should be easily recognisable, as well as simple to draw so you can remember it. For my leatter head, I didn't want <br>
                to distract fron the content of the page so I left out all color, and stuck to thin lines. The pattern is a topographic pattern used to depict hills and general changes in <br>
                elevation. Finaly for mu business cards, These would be what is handed out to people and seen the most. I have 3 goals with my business card, I want to attract the<br>
                persons eye with an interesting design, allow them to quickly understand who I am and what I do, and lastly they should be able to contact me in multiple ways.
